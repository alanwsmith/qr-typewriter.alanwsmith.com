## Overview

This project is an experiment to see what
typing with QR Codes instead of letters
looks like. There's no practical use
I can think of for it other than it
looks kinda cool. 

## Details 

The QR codes are generated by the 
[Lean QR](https://qr.davidje13.com/docs/)
library. It makes a canvas element
for each character's QR code. 
[bitty-js](https://bitty-js.alanwsmith.com/)
powers the interface. 

Spaces show up as spaces in the output. 
Everything else shows up as the corresponding
QR Code. 

No attempt is made to keep words from breaking
across lines.  Things won't line up exactly as 
a result.


## Performance

The typewriter works fine on my M1 Mac
up to a given point. If the text starts
getting longer than a few sentences
it starts to bog down. 
Mileage may vary.
